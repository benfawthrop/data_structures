Remember: Your implementation for this assignment must be done on your
own, as described in "Academic Integrity for Homework" handout.


ESTIMATE OF # OF HOURS SPENT ON THIS ASSIGNMENT:  30


TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your implementation?

I attempted to debug using lldb and the built-in CLion debugger,
which allows you to see a better visualization of your errors than
lldb or gbd permit.


MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
(optional, please be concise!)

I kept getting a linker command error, which I spent hours on hours
debugging to no avail.
