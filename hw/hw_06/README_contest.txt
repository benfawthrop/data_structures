HOMEWORK 6 CONTEST: INVERSE WORD SEARCH


NAME:  Ben Fawthrop


OPTIMIZATIONS:
What did you do?
I didn't optimize my code



TEST CASE SUMMARY:
How did your program perform on the different test cases?  Summarize
the running times.  (It's ok if it didn't finish the harder examples.)
What new test cases did you create and how did it perform on those
tests?
PUZZLE      RUN TIME    SOLUTIONS
1           0.008s      8
2           0.009s      4
3           2.520s      8
5           0.059s      100
6           1.380s      216
7           1.550s      80
mine1       0.083s      2912

the case mine1 looks like this:
4 4
+ frog
+ bear
- lion
- deer
    I built this case to test the random letter filler function
    As you can see, it builds a lot of solutions because there
    are quite a few open coords.
