DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC:
Please be concise! (< 200 words)
What question you are trying to answer with your statistic? 
What data did you need to organize? 
What was interesting or challenging about the implementation of this statistic? 

My statistic is fairly simple.  It shows the average scoring participation of all of the players
in the league.
It also shows the highest and lowest data points in the data set (player with the most goals and assists and the player with the least)
The math behind this calculation is the sum of all of the goals and assists divided by the number of players.

This is an interesting statistic because it shows us the utility of each player compared to the average. A real hockey team
might use a much more advanced version of this utility calculation to determine if they pick up a new player or not

MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!

I used the 2012 small input for my custom stat input because it was really interesting that there were so many players
who were clear outliers.  For example, Ryan_Haggerty's utility is 9 goals per season, which is almost 7 above
the average.
