// is the indicator for an in line comment

/* is the indicator for the start of a multi line comment

*/ is the indicator for the end of a multi line comment

/* this is an example of a multi line comment */

# is used for special statements

for example, when we are importing header files, those calls look like this

    #include <iostream>
    #include <cmath>

every single program written in c++ must have a main function
this function must have a return type of indicator

All functions and variables in c++ programs must be given a type
    examples of types are:
        -void (no return value)
        -int (integer)
        -bool (boolean value)
        -float (floating point value)
        -double (float value with more bytes of memory)
        -char (character)

There are shortcuts that can be done in c++ similar to python
one example of this is 
    using namespace std;

    this allows us to use functions such as std::cin or std::cout without writing std::

    this can lead to problems with objects defined by the user having the same name as std:: functions
