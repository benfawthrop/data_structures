    For and While loops
        here is a basic example in c++

            for (expr1; expr2; expr3)
                statement;
            
        - expr1; 
            is the initial expression executed at the start before the loop iterations begin;
        – expr2;
            is the test applied before the beginning of each loop iteration, the loop ends when this expression
            evaluates to false or 0;
        – expr3;
            is evaluated at the very end of each iteration;
        – statement 
            is the “loop body”
